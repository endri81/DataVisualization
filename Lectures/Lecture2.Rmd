# Introduction

## The grammar of graphics

The first step in thinking creatively about data visualization is to appreciate that graphics are built upon an underlying grammar.

## The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

    - To begin, let's consider one of the most well-known sentences in English. 
    
    - The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

## The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

    - Every word in the sentence has a clear grammatical definition and when we write text, we take great care to choose the grammatical elements so that we communicate a very specific message.

## Grammar of graphics

    - If we changed any of the grammatical elements of this sentence it would change the meaning, sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically.

    - The same concept holds true for data visualization - graphics are built on an underlying grammar. 

## Grammar of graphics    

    - The grammar of graphics is a plotting framework developed by Leland Wilkinson and published in his 1999 book, *The Grammar of Graphics*.

## Grammar of graphics

There are two key things to note about the grammar of graphics. 
    
    - First, graphics are made up of distinct layers of grammatical elements, 
    
    - Second, meaningful plots are built around appropriate aesthetic mappings. 
    
## Grammar of graphics

- To continue our analogy to written grammar, the layers are like the adjectives and nouns and the aesthetic mappings are like the grammatical rules for how to assemble that vocabulary.

## The three essential grammatical elements

Let's explore grammatical elements first. 


## The three essential grammatical elements

There are three essential grammatical elements: data, aesthetics, and geometries.

## The three essential grammatical elements

- The data is obviously the data which we want to plot.

 ## The three essential grammatical elements

- The aesthetics layer refers to the scales onto which we will map our data, and the geom layer refers to the actual shape the data will take in the plot.

- The geom layer refers to the actual shape the data will take in the plot.

## Core competency

The rest are optional layers.

This includes the theme layer, which controls all the non-data ink. In this lecture, we'll cover these first four layers which will comprise your core competency.

## The seven grammatical elements

In the next lecture we'll explore the remaining grammatical elements: the statistics, coordinates and facets layers.

## Jargon for each element

This diagram gives an example of some of the terms we'll encounter in each element.

## Jargon for each element

    - Whenever we make a plot we are choosing among these options and many others not displayed. 
    
    - By the end of this lecture you'll be able to generate meaningful and publication-quality exploratory plots using the first four layers.
