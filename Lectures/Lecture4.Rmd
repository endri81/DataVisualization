# Introduction

##  Introduction to leaflet

Welcome to this course on creating interactive maps using the **leaflet** package. 

## leaflet

  - Leaflet is a popular open-source JavaScript library for creating mobile-friendly, interactive maps. 
  
  - Thanks to the work of many leading R developers, we can create interactive maps with just a few lines of R code. 
  
  - You may already be familiar with leaflet maps, as they are used by leading technology companies, nonprofits, and government organizations to create informative and interactive maps.

## leaflet Example: National Parks Service

  - For example, the National Parks Service uses leaflet to create an interactive map of America's National Parks. 
  
![](../images/im217.png)  

## leaflet Example: National Parks Service

  - This map enables users to explore parks and monuments by state. 
  
  - For example, Maine, has one National Park, one International Park, and one National Monument. Clicking on any of these locations reveals a pop-up with additional information.

## What We are Working Toward

  - In this lecture, we will work towards building an interactive map like the one shown on this slide. 
  
![](../images/im218.png)   

## What We are Working Toward

  - This leaflet map plots all four-year colleges in America and color codes these institutions by sector to indicate if they are public, private, or            for-profit. 
  
  - Using the control panel in the upper right-hand corner, we can toggle the map between different base maps and we can select which sectors of colleges        appear on the map. 
  
## What We are Working Toward

  Later in the lecture, we will add a few pieces of flair to this map, such as labels that appear when hovering and the ability to search for a particular     college.

## Creating our First leaflet Map

  - But first we will learn about the core features of the leaflet library by mapping locations in Belgium and New York. 
  
  
## Creating our First leaflet Map  
  
  - **leaflet** builds maps using tiles. 
  
  - Tiled web maps join many map images together and when a user zooms or pans your interactive leaflet map, new tiles are fetched as needed to provide the     requested view of the map. 

## Creating our First leaflet Map  
  
Let's take a look at how this works in R. 
  
\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE} 
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()
```  
  
  First, we load the leaflet library. 
  

## Creating our First leaflet Map  
  
Then we initialize an html widget with the leaflet() function call. 
  
\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE} 
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()
```  
  
## Creating our First leaflet Map    

- You'll notice that leaflet leverages the pipe operator that is common in the tidyverse. 
   
   - This allows us to chain a series of functions together. 
   
   
## Creating our First leaflet Map

   For example, we can pipe the result of our 'leaflet(); call into the 'addTiles()' function to create an interactive map with just two-lines of R code!
  
  ![](../images/im220.png)   

## Where We are Going 

- For now, you will practice using different map tiles while working towards creating an interactive map that displays two of college's locations. 

  - Similar to adding a provider tile, you can add another layer to your map using the pipe operator to include markers that identify specific locations.


## Practice : Creating a Basic Web Map in R

We will use the leaflet package to initialize an HTML widget and add a map tile using addTiles().

**Steps:**

  - Load the leaflet library.

  - Call the leaflet() function to initialize the map.

  - Pipe the output into addTiles() to add default map tiles.

  - Run and explore the interactive map.


## Practice : Using Pipe Operators for Data Manipulation


\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE} 
# Load the leaflet library
library(leaflet)

# Create a leaflet map with a default map tile using addTiles()
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()
```

## Interactive Map Features

  - Zooming: Scroll or use buttons to zoom in/out.
  - Panning: Click and drag to move the map.
  - Customization: You can add markers, polygons, and popups.
  
## Provider Tiles

  - The leaflet package comes with over 100 base maps you can use. 
  
![](../images/im221.png)     
  
  - Now, we will start to explore the various tiles that we can use as the foundation of our web maps.

## Selecting a Base Map

  - As you work through the exercises, I encourage you to experiment with different base maps to expand your awareness of the available options. 
  
  - When you are selecting a base map there are several important questions to consider.
  
## Selecting a Base Map

  - Perhaps, primary among them is "Why are you making this map in the first place?" 
  
  - Is this map just for your use or is it part of a larger project that should fit within an existing design framework? 
  
  
## Selecting a Base Map

  - Secondly, "what type of data will you be plotting?" 
  
  - Will the geographic and topographic features of the base map add to the information you are presenting or confuse your users?

## Selecting a Base Map

  - In my work, I tend to prefer grayscale maps when plotting data. 
  
  - I find that these maps make it easier for me to distinguish between the data that I am plotting and the data included with the base map. 
  
## Selecting a Base Map

  - For example, in the map on the left the points are similar in color to features of base map, like the lakes, whereas in the map on the right the data we are plotting is easily distinguishable from the features of the base map.

## leaflet Provider List

  - There are over 100 provider tiles included in the leaflet package.
  
  - Most of these tiles you can use by calling the $addProviderTiles()$ function. 
  
## leaflet Provider List  
  
  - However, there are a few, like mapbox, that you will need to register for prior to using them. 
  
  - You can access the names of the provider tiles included in the leaflet package by calling the **names()** function on the providers list.
  
  
## leaflet Provider List  
  
  For example, to see the first five provider tiles, we call names() on the providers list followed by 1 colon 5 in brackets.

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}
```{r, cache=TRUE} 
names(providers)[1:5]
```

## Exploring leaflet Provider Tiles

The first five tiles are all OpenStreetMap tiles, so it might be more useful to print all of the tiles provided by OpenStreetMap, which you can do by using the $str\_detect()$ function from the **stringr** package.

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE} 
names(providers)[str_detect(names(providers), "OpenStreetMap")]
```

## addProviderTiles()

  - We can swap the default base map out for any of the included provider tiles using the **addProviderTiles()** function. 
  

For example, to create a leaflet map that uses the black and white OpenStreetMap, we replace the $addTiles()$ with $addProviderTiles()$ and pass in the name of the desired tile to the function.

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE} 
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite")
```


## Practice : Provider Tiles in Leaflet

- In previous exercises, we used `addTiles()` to add the default OpenStreetMap (OSM) tile.
- Leaflet provides **more than 100** provider tiles stored in the `providers` list.
- These can be used with `addProviderTiles()` instead of `addTiles()`.


## View all available map tiles

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE} 
# Print the providers list included in the leaflet library
providers
```

## Print only provider tile names

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Print only the names of the map tiles in the providers list
names(providers)
```

## Filtering Provider Tiles

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(stringr)

# Use str_detect() to find provider names containing "CartoDB"
str_detect(names(providers), "CartoDB")
```


## Print the actual provider names

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(stringr)
# Display provider tile names that include "CartoDB"
names(providers)[str_detect(names(providers), "CartoDB")]
```


## Adding a Custom Map Tile

Instead of the default OSM tile, we can use CartoDB or other tiles.

The function addProviderTiles() allows us to specify a provider from the list.

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(stringr)
library(leaflet)
# Change addTiles() to addProviderTiles() and set provider to "CartoDB"
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(provider = "CartoDB")
```



## Adding a Custom Map Tile

Now, that we have got the different providers, let’s try one of them and see how it’s different than the default one.

The first argument to addProviderTiles() is your leaflet map, which allows us to pipe leaflet() output directly into addProviderTiles(). 


## Adding a Custom Map Tile

The second argument is provider, which accepts any of the map tiles included in the providers list.


\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
leaflet() %>% 
    addProviderTiles(provider = "CartoDB.DarkMatterNoLabels")
```

I’ve used the ‘CartoDB.DarkMatterNoLabels’ provider. And it has turned the map into dark mode actually!

## A Map with a View

You may have noticed that, by default, maps are zoomed out to the farthest level. 

Rather than manually zooming and panning, we can load the map centered on a particular point using the setView() function.

## A Map with a View

The default zoom level is 0 and can reach upto 19. 0 being the zoomed out stage.

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
leaflet()  %>% 
    addProviderTiles("CartoDB")  %>% 
    setView(lat = 27.1751, lng = 78.0421, zoom = 16)
```

## A Map with a Narrower View

We can limit users’ ability to pan away from the map’s focus using the options argument in the leaflet() function. 

By setting minZoom and dragging, we can create an interactive web map that will always be focused on a specific area. 

Although, user can zoom out using controls.


## A Map with a Narrower View


\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
leaflet(options = 
        leafletOptions(minZoom = 14, dragging = FALSE))  %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB")  %>% 
  setView(lng = 78.0421, lat = 27.1751, zoom = 16) 
```

## A Map with a Narrower View

Alternatively, if we want our users to be able to drag the map while ensuring that they do not stray too far, we can set the maps maximum boundaries by specifying two diagonal corners of a rectangle.


## A Map with a Narrower View

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(tibble)
## Warning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.0.5
#R package that provides easy to use functions for creating tibbles, which is a modern rethinking of data frames. 

wonders <- tibble(
  place = c("Taj Mahal - India", "Petra - Jordan", "Christ the Redeemer - Brazil", "Colosseum - Italy"),
  lon = c(78.0421, 35.4444, 43.2105, 12.4922),
  lat = c(27.1751, 30.3285, 22.9519, 41.8902))
```



## A Map with a Narrower View

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
leaflet(options = leafletOptions(
                    # Set minZoom and dragging 
                    minZoom = 12, dragging = TRUE))  %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB")  %>% 
  
  # Set default zoom level 
  setView(lng = wonders$lon[2], lat = wonders$lat[2], zoom = 10) %>% 
  
  # Set max bounds of map 
  setMaxBounds(lng1 = wonders$lon[2] + .05, 
               lat1 = wonders$lat[2] + .05, 
               lng2 = wonders$lon[2] - .05, 
               lat2 = wonders$lat[2] - .05) 
```


## A Map with a Narrower View

Try, dragging this map. What do you notice. 

It cannot be dragged more than the max bounds we have set i.e. 0.05. 

So, the map stays in the focused mode and cannot be dragged further than set limits.

## Adding Markers

So far we have been creating maps with a single layer: a base map. 

We can add layers to this base map similar to how you add layers to a plot in ggplot2. 


## Adding Markers

One of the most common layers to add to a leaflet map is location markers, which you can add by piping the result of addTiles() or addProviderTiles() into the add markers function.

## Adding Markers

For example, if we plot Taj Mahal by passing the coordinates to addMarkers() as numeric vectors with one element, our web map will place a blue drop pin at the coordinate.


## Adding Markers

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap") %>%
  addMarkers(lng = wonders$lon[2], lat = wonders$lat[2])
```

## Add maps and store map as a R object

To make our map more informative we can add popups. 

To add popups that appear when a marker is clicked we need to specify the popup argument in the addMarkers() function. 

## Add maps and store map as a R object

Once we have a map we would like to preserve, we can store it in an object. 

Then we can pipe this object into functions to add or edit the map’s layers.


## Add maps and store map as a R object

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
wondersMap <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = wonders$lon, lat = wonders$lat,
             popup = wonders$place)
```



## Add maps and store map as a R object

We can add layers to the existing leaflet R object


\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
map_zoom <- wondersMap %>%
  setView(lng = wonders$lon[4], lat = wonders$lat[4], zoom = 2)

map_zoom
```

## Cleaning up the Base Map

If you are storing leaflet maps in objects, there will come a time when you need to remove markers or reset the view. 

You can accomplish these tasks with the following functions.

  - clearMarkers()- Remove one or more features from a map

  - clearBounds()- Clear bounds and automatically determine bounds based on map elements

## Cleaning up the Base Map

To remove the markers and to reset the bounds of our m map we would:

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
map_zoom <- map_zoom %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = wonders$lon, lat = wonders$lat) %>%
  setView(lng = 20.6843, lat = 88.5678, zoom = 5)

map_zoom %>%
  clearMarkers() %>%
  clearBounds()
```


## Adding Markers

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()  %>%
  addMarkers(lat=39.2980803, lng=-76.5898801, 
             popup="Jeff Leek's Office")
my_map
```


## Adding Many Markers

Adding one marker at a time is often not practical if you want to display many markers. 

If you have a data frame with columns lat and lng you can pipe that data frame into leaflet() to add all the points at once.


## Adding Many Markers

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(2016-04-25)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(20, min = 39.2, max = 39.3),
                 lng = runif(20, min = -76.6, max = -76.5))
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers()
```



## Making Custom Markers

The blue markers that leaflet comes packaged with may not be enough depending on what you’re mapping. 

Thankfully you can make your own markers from .png files.



## Making Custom Markers

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
unytIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Logo_of_the_University_of_New_York%E2%80%93Tirana.svg/150px-Logo_of_the_University_of_New_York%E2%80%93Tirana.svg.png",
  iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
  iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)
```


## Making Custom Markers

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}

unytLatLong <- data.frame(
  lat = c(41.3275),  # Latitude of UNYT
  lng = c(19.8189)   # Longitude of UNYT
)

unytLatLong %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = unytIcon)

```


## Adding Multiple Popups

When adding multiple markers to a map, you may want to add popups for each marker. 

You can specify a string of plain text for each popup, or you can provide HTML which will be rendered inside of each popup.



## Adding Multiple Popups

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
unytSites <- c(
  "<a href='https://unyt.edu.al/'>University of New York Tirana</a>",
  "<a href='https://unyt.edu.al/academics/'>UNYT Academics</a>",
  "<a href='https://unyt.edu.al/research/'>UNYT Research Center</a>",
  "<a href='https://unyt.edu.al/admissions/'>UNYT Admissions</a>",
  "<a href='https://unyt.edu.al/contact/'>UNYT Contact</a>"
)
```

## Adding Multiple Popups

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
unytLatLong <- data.frame(
  lat = c(41.3275, 41.3280, 41.3268, 41.3272, 41.3282),  # Approximate locations
  lng = c(19.8189, 19.8195, 19.8178, 19.8201, 19.8182)   # Adjusted for different locations
)
```

## Adding Multiple Popups

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
unytIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Logo_of_the_University_of_New_York%E2%80%93Tirana.svg/150px-Logo_of_the_University_of_New_York%E2%80%93Tirana.svg.png",
  iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
  iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)
```

## Adding Multiple Popups

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}

unytLatLong %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = unytIcon, popup = unytSites)


```



## Mapping Clusters

Sometimes you might have so many points on a map that it doesn’t make sense to plot every marker. 

In these situations leaflet allows you to plot clusters of markers using addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()). 

When you zoom in to each cluster, the clusters will separate until you can see the individual markers.


## Mapping Clusters

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Generate 20 random points around the University of New York Tirana
df <- data.frame(
  lat = runif(20, min = 41.315, max = 41.335),  # Latitude range for Tirana
  lng = runif(20, min = 19.805, max = 19.830)   # Longitude range for Tirana
)
```


## Mapping Clusters

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Create a leaflet map with circle markers
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    radius = 5,  # Size of the circles
    color = "blue",  # Outline color
    fillColor = "lightblue",  # Fill color
    fillOpacity = 0.5,  # Transparency level
    stroke = TRUE
  )


```

## Mapping Clusters

Instead of adding markers or clusters you can easily add circle markers using addCircleMarkers().


## Mapping Clusters

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Generate 500 random points around Tirana, Albania
df <- data.frame(
  lat = runif(500, min = 41.315, max = 41.335),  # Latitude range for Tirana
  lng = runif(500, min = 19.805, max = 19.830)   # Longitude range for Tirana
)
```

## Mapping Clusters

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Create a leaflet map with clustered markers
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())


```



## Drawing Circles

You can draw arbitrary shapes on the maps you create, including circles and squares. 

The code below draws a map where the circle on each city is proportional to the population of that city.


## Drawing Circles

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Data for major cities in Albania with estimated population
albania_cities <- data.frame(
  name = c("Tirana", "Durres", "Vlore", "Shkoder", "Fier",
           "Korce", "Berat", "Elbasan", "Lushnje", "Gjirokaster"),
  pop = c(418495, 201110, 130827, 135612, 120655,
          75694, 60331, 141714, 83274, 25000),  # Approximate population values
  lat = c(41.3275, 41.3167, 40.4667, 42.0667, 40.7250,
          40.6167, 40.7050, 41.1125, 40.9333, 40.0783),
  lng = c(19.8189, 19.4500, 19.4897, 19.5156, 19.5561,
          20.7667, 19.9522, 20.0822, 19.7050, 20.1333)
)
```

## Drawing Circles

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Create a leaflet map with circle sizes representing city population
albania_cities %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(
    weight = 1,
    radius = sqrt(albania_cities$pop) * 30,  # Adjusted radius to scale with population
    color = "blue",  # Outline color
    fillColor = "lightblue",  # Fill color
    fillOpacity = 0.5,  # Transparency
    popup = ~paste0("<b>", name, "</b><br>Population: ", pop)  # Popup with city name & population
  )
```



## Drawing Rectangles

You can add rectangles on leaflet maps as well:



## Drawing Rectangles

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Create a leaflet map with a rectangle in Tirana
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addRectangles(
    lat1 = 41.3220, lng1 = 19.8100,  # Bottom-left corner of rectangle
    lat2 = 41.3300, lng2 = 19.8250,  # Top-right corner of rectangle
    color = "black", weight = 2, fillOpacity = 0.3
  )
```


## Drawing Rectangles

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Generate 20 random points around Tirana with different colors
df <- data.frame(
  lat = runif(20, min = 41.315, max = 41.335),  # Latitude range for Tirana
  lng = runif(20, min = 19.805, max = 19.830),  # Longitude range for Tirana
  col = sample(c("red", "blue", "green"), 20, replace = TRUE),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

## Drawing Rectangles

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Create a leaflet map with circle markers and a legend
df %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(color = df$col, fillOpacity = 0.7, radius = 5) %>%
  addLegend(position = "bottomright",
            labels = c("Category A", "Category B", "Category C"),
            colors = c("blue", "red", "green"),
            title = "Legend for Categories")

```


## Adding Legends


Adding a legend can be useful if you have markers on your map with different colors:


## Adding Legends


\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Generate 20 random points around Tirana with different colors
df <- data.frame(
  lat = runif(20, min = 41.315, max = 41.335),  # Latitude range for Tirana
  lng = runif(20, min = 19.805, max = 19.830),  # Longitude range for Tirana
  col = sample(c("red", "blue", "green"), 20, replace = TRUE),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```



## Adding Legends
\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\tiny}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Create a leaflet map with circle markers and a legend
df %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    color = df$col,
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    radius = 5
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    position = "bottomright",
    labels = c("Category A", "Category B", "Category C"),
    colors = c("blue", "red", "green"),
    title = "Legend for Categories"
  )

```
